### Description

Sample iOS app demonstrating animations.
Drunken Calculator shuffles its buttons, so after a while it is hard to use (honestly, I do not expect anyone using this app as real calculator, it is rather a toy).
Swipe display to the right to delete last digit from the display.
Swipe display to the left to reset buttons to its initial positions.
